# Hi! 👋

I'm Aurel - CTO at [HD Rain](https://www.hd-rain.com/home/en) building climate risk management solutions.

## What I do

**By day:** Leading a 5-person engineering team processing weather data at scale for parametric insurance.

**By night:** Exploring game development, SaaS building, and creative projects I've postponed for years.

**Philosophy:** Advocate for Extreme Programming (TDD, pair programming), Functional Programming, and Lean Product Management.

## Background

**20+ years building software** - from teenage game modding through parallel careers in archaeology and engineering.

**Game development (2002-2011):**
- Modded *Neverwinter Nights* with custom engines (persistent multiplayer RPG servers)
- Built tools with NWScript (C-like), Python, HTML/CSS/JS
- Game design: writing, level design, character development

**Parallel careers (2007-2012):**
- **Freelance software engineering:** Building products for clients while simultaneously...
- **Archaeology engineer (started 2008):** Working in preventive archaeology
  - Specialized in Neolithic and proto-historic periods (Bronze and Iron Ages)
  - European Atlantic facade focus (Gibraltar to Yell Strait)
  - Socio-technological aspects of long-distance trade and navigation

**Archaeology focus (2012-2015):**
- Stopped freelancing to focus fully on archaeology
- Contracts: site assessment, surveying, excavation, scientific documentation
- France and Spain

**Full-time software engineering (2015+):**
- Returned to software engineering full-time
- Fullstack roles across startups and scale-ups
