# Hi Goblin! 😈

## Who am I? 

Aurel or Maeevick, born in 1985, married to an amazing woman and father of an incredible little boy.

__Not interested__? Ok I may understand 😁

I'm a programmer, developer, crafter, product engineer or whatever you want to qualify the fact of making high quality digital products to provide value to users!

Currently, I'm the CTO of https://thetribe.io in Nantes - France

My blog with some thoughts is at https://www.goblinsatcode.xyz built with hakyll 💚

I'm not the most technical and talented guy on the Earth, but I'm convinced that we can learn and improve every day.

I'm mainly a javascript / typescript programmer, on frontend and backend. I like Python too and I worked with Java, C# few years ago. 
Today, I'm on the long road to improve my Haskell, Elixir and DevOps skills and techniques.

I prefer to focus on _Deep Skills_ and _Soft Skills_ like :

- software architecture ("hexagonal architecture / port adapters patterns" or "functional core - imperative shell"...) 
- extreme programming techniques (pair-programming, test driven development, fast feedback loop, introspection...)
- helping, sharing, growing, learning day to day... as an individu and as a __team__
