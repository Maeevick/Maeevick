# Hi Goblin! üòà

## Who ? 

Aurel or Maeevick, born in 1985, married to an amazing woman and father of an incredible little boy.

__Not interested__? Ok I may understand üòÅ

I'm a programmer, developer, crafter, product engineer or whatever you want to qualify the fact of making high quality digital products to provide value to users!

Currently, I'm the CTO/VP Eng of https://thetribe.io in Nantes - France

My blog with some thoughts is at https://www.goblinsatcode.xyz built with hakyll üíö

I'm not the most technical and talented guy on the Web, but I'm convinced that we can learn and improve every day and I try to apply this to myself.

I'm mainly a javascript / typescript programmer, both frontend and backend. I like Python too and I worked with Java, C# few years ago. 
Today, I'm on the long road to improve my Haskell, Elixir and DevOps skills and techniques.

I prefer to focus on _Deep Skills_ and _Soft Skills_ (than on pure _Hard Skill_ : know by heart a tool or a framework) like :

- software architecture ("hexagonal architecture / port adapters patterns" or "functional core - imperative shell"...) 
- extreme programming techniques (pair-programming, test driven development, fast feedback loop, introspection...)
- helping, sharing, growing, learning day to day... as an individu and as a __team__ 
- improve my communication skills (I have some work on this topic) and experiment new collaboration practices
- language's best practices and specificities


## What ?

I develop web products for more or less 15 years (from 2021). However, I have not 15 years of experience in Web Development due to change in my career (I started as a Web Developer, then I became Archaeologist and I came back to Web and Mobile Development in 2015). __Today, I won't change again, product engineer is my vocation, my path, my career__.

As a hobbyist, I develop casual video games for myself, my friends and my family. I don't know why I never published anything publicly, fear ? (lack of) confidence ? As I promote public learning the next one will be public.

I have several ideas about some interesting Software as a Service (SaaS). I have to priorize and find time but it's a goal to try to fix some users' problems that I see.

## How ?

As I said, I'm not the most talented developer on the Earth, so I use some techniques used by Extreme Programmers / Software Crafters and DevOps to ensure products of high quality : 

- Behavior Driven Development
- Domain Driven Design
- Acceptance Testing Driven Development
- Test Driven Development
- Mutation Testing
- Hexagonal Architecture
- Functional Core / Imperative Shell
- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Deployment
- Infrastructure as Code
- Infrastructure as a Service

All of these techniques and tools may only work with __a continuous collaboration with end users__. I'm convinced theses techniques and tools __reduce the feedback loop and help the product to evolve seamlessly__.


## Resources

‚ö†Ô∏è Not an exhaustive or a prescriptive list of resources, it's __my__ fondamental resources to improve myself.

_I have no links with amazon, I use it here as any other library_
